### Projects 
These projects are a work in progress, and I am working to enhance and refine their features.  <br />
If you have any advice, recommendations, or ideas on how I can improve them, please don't hesitate to reach out.

  Created as part of a two-week bootcamp project.<br />
  The project is designed to make it easy for dog owners to discover nearby dog walks and connect with other dog owners for group walks in the Lyon region.<br />
  ðŸ“Œ BaladeTonChien relies on Ruby gems, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, Redis and Mapbox for its functionality. All of the data is sourced from the Grand Lyon API, with the inclusion of some additional walks through JSON. Testing is done with Rspec.

  Created as part of a one week bootcamp marketplace project.<br />
  It offers a costume library where users can browse, search, and filter costumes, as well as rent or list their own costumes easily. <br />
