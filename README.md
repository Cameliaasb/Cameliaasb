### Projects 
These projects are a work in progress, and I am actively working to enhance and refine their features.  <br />
If you have any advice, recommendations, or ideas on how I can improve them, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

- **BaladeTonChien** <br />
  Created as part of a two-week bootcamp project.<br />
  The project is designed to make it easy for dog owners to discover nearby dog walks and connect with other dog owners for group walks in the Lyon region.<br />
  ðŸ“Œ BaladeTonChien relies on Ruby gems, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, Redis and Mapbox for its functionality. All of the data is sourced from the Grand Lyon API, with the inclusion of some additional walks through JSON. Testing is done with Rspec. It is deployed on Heroku.
  
- **CostumeMania** <br />
  Created as part of a one week bootcamp marketplace project.<br />
  It offers a costume library where users can browse, search, and filter costumes, as well as rent or list their own costumes easily. <br />
  ðŸ“Œ The application relies on Ruby gems, PostgreSQL, StimulusJS, and Cloudinary for its functionality. All data is user-generated. Testing is done with Minitest. It is deployed on Heroku.

- **TravelPlanner** <br />
  A rails application created as a learning project to practice TDD.<br />
  TripPlanner is a platform designed to simplify travel planning and coordination. It provides an intuitive interface  with features such as chat, open topics, to-do lists, and updates to streamline the planning process. <br />
  ðŸ“Œ The application relies on Ruby gems, PostgreSQL, StimulusJS, Redis, and Cloudinary for its functionality. All data is user-generated. Testing is done with Minitest.

- **Cocktails** <br />
   A ReactJS application created as a learning project to gain experience in React development, utilizing "create-react-app." <br />
